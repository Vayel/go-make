# go-make

A parallel version of the `make` tool in Go which uses RPC. Works with
basic Makefiles only.

# Commands

## Install

```bash
make
```

## Run master

```bash
make run_master fname-in-makefiles-dir
```

For instance:

```bash
make run_master 8
```

## Run slave

```bash
make run_slave1
# Or: make run_slave2
```

# Makefiles
This tool handles only basic Makefiles. All the rules must look like:
```
target: dep1 dep2 dep3
	instruction1
	instruction2
```

And all the rules must create a file of the same name. In the case where a rule has to use an external file (a file that has not been generated by a previous rule), it has to be given to all the slaves. It is not very efficient, but it doesn't affect our performance tests since the cost is just at the begining.
